# Ben's Experiments

I created this website for the following reasons:

* I needed a place to experiment with code outside of work (so why not make it public)
* I was not doing as much UI as I would like to at work
* I have a number of old projects that I want to clean up and make public (there are still many more to come)

None of the experiments on this site are what I would consider to be my best work (including the design which looks like 
it was done third grader).  But I believe it is better to push with a minimum viable product that can be enhanced later in
favor of waiting for perfection that might take years to acheive.  It's always better to release small chunks and iterate
as necessary.

Please keep in mind that there is plenty of code here that I am not proud of.  However, I am not embarassed because as I mentioned
above, I'd rather have something to show.
