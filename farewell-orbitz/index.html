                    Day and night, I toss and turn. I keep stressing my mind.  I look for peace, but see see I don't attain 
                    what I need for keeps.  This silly game we play.  Now look at this.  Madness, the magnet, keeps attracting me. 
                    I try to run, but see I'm am not that fast.  I think I'm first but surely finish last.

                        I get rich.  Night shift.  6 to 6.  Give me one shot, one pot.  I'll show up in all white wearing
                        no socks...
                        I'm three steps removed.  I know how to move.  It's loking like I don't know how to lose.  I'm
                        winning again...  I'm at the tablet.  I'm gambling.  Lucky lefty.  I expect a 7.  I went through
                        hell, I'm expecting heaven.  I'm owed.  I'm throwed... 
                        
                        I'm here, oh yeah.  I promise I ain't going nowhere.  OK, here.  Like a hare.  Like a rabbit.  
                        I like karats.  I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears.  Like broke?  Like nope.  Like ha, I ain't no
                        joke.  I can't be stopped.  Like nope.  Like nope.
                        
                        Two seast in the nine eleven.  No limit on the black card.  Told y'all I was gonna go HAM.  Told the
                        ocean was my backyard.  No lies in my verses.  Please pardon all the curses.  Shit gotta come out some
                        way when you're growin'up worthless.
                        
                        Middle finger to my old life.  Special shout out to my old head.  If it wasn't for your advice.  I would
                        have been so dead.  Livin' life 'til these bitches kill me...
                        
                        Street smart and I'm book smart.  Coulda been a chemist 'cause I cook smart.  Only this to stop me is 
                        me, and I'm gonna' stop me when the hook start.

                This is really one you have to listen to.  Very explicit, but awesome.

                As corny as this song feels, I fricking love it.  I was really happy when pop music finally 
                went clubby.  The words in this song are so blatantly obvious that they need no explanation

                If I'm being true to myself, I'm gonna have to include some rap in here.  I fricking love this song and
                it's got some great lines.  It gets pretty explict, but starts pretty mild.  If you ever walked by my desk
                and saw me with a goofy grin on my face, this might have been one of the songs I was listening to.

                        ...but there's way to much at stake for me to be fake.  There's too much on my plate, and I came way too
                        far in this game to turn and walk away and not say what I got to say...  I get up 'fore I get down. Run
                        myself in the ground before I put some wack shit out.  I'm trying to smack this one out the park.  Five
                        thousand marks.  Ya'll steady tryin' to drown the shark.  Ain't gonna do nothing but
                        piss me off.  Lid to the can off whip-ass, just twist me off... Talk is cheap.  Motherfucker, if 
                        you're really feeling froggish leap...

                        "Yo Slim, you gonna let him get away with that?  He tried to play you.  You can't let him skate with
                        that."  Man I hate this crap.  This ain't rap.  This is crazy, the way we act, when we confuse hip-hop 
                        with real life when the music stops.
