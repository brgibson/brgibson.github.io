            <h1>About Ben</h1>

            <p>
                Ben is a software engineer at Orbitz Worldwide.
                He lives with his wife in the Chicago area.
            </p>

            <p>
                He created this website for the following reasons:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Needed a place to experiment with code outside of work</li>
                <li>Having a number of old projects to clean up and make public (there are still many more to come)</li>
                <li>Not doing as much UI as he would like</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                None of the experiments on this site are what he would consider to be his best work, but he believes it is better to push
                with a minimum viable product that can be enhanced later in
                favor of waiting for perfection that might take years to acheive.  It's better to release small chunks of work and iterate
                as time allows.
            </p>
