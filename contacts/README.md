In [mockup.png](./mockup.png?raw=true) are three states of a new contacts widget that could be used on
a hypothetical consumer-facing website.  The widget may be anywhere on the
page. Designers will also use this in mocks for usability tests.
 
Please create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the widget as described in the
image. Your solution must work in Firefox 3.5+ and IE7+.  

Do not use any JavaScript libraries that you did not write yourself. Bonus 
points will be given to a solution that degrades nicely on older browsers and
is reusable across multiple pages and sites.

The data is provided in [data.html](./data.html)

The mockup is included below.
