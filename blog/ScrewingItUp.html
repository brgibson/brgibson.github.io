> "Embrace failure and move forward." 

My manager once told me that one of the most important lessons you can learn is how to embrace failure and move forward.

As a software engineer, any code we write or decision we make has the potential for failure.  Failure *will* happen and we must embrace it, learn from our mistakes, and move forward.  

So get out there, make mistakes, and build some beautiful software!
