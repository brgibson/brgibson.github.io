A teacher once explained to me that when you are contracting out work, there are three things that you have to balance.

- Quality - You can have something done well.
- Speed - You can have something done quickly.
- Cost - You can have something done inexpensively.

If you want something done well and you want it done quickly, you are going to have to pay through the nose for it.  However if you want it done well, but really can't spend much money on it, then you are going to have to be patient, because it's going to take a long time.  But if you need speed and low cost, then you are going to have to sacrifice on quality.

I feel like this is a lesson we often forget.  Nevertheless, it is one worth remembering.
