#### ...to saying no.  
 
## When did we start saying no?

If your codebase is going to hell in a handbasket because developers are rushing to hack features together and can never find the time to clean up their crappy code, you might start mandating code reviews and add a vangaurd of senior developers who are the only ones allowed to push code.  

While this may be a good short term solution in order to force people to check in clean code, in the long run it will bring your agility to a standstill and make your job a living hell.  It does not address the root cause of the problem, but merely covers it up with a process Band-Aid (and it will hurt when you are ready to rip it off).

## The Real Issues

1. Tight and inflexible deadlines do not allow for the reduction of technical debt.
2. The developer rampup process is not working.
3. You don't have the right automated tests.

### Deadlines
The biggest reason why code gets messy and unmaintainable is because of deadlines.  Deadlines aren't inherently bad, and they can be a great way to set expectations and get people to bear down and get something accomplished.  But after we've completed our first iteration, we need to stop, take a good look at what we've built, and take on any cleanup that is needed.

### Rampup
Why are we relying on code reviews to pass shared knowledge between developers?  It is better to invest more time and energy into developer rampup and to find ways to share knowledge before a code review.

### Automation
A good set of automated tests will not only enforce clean and maintanable code, but they will also act as your safegaurd from catastrophic failure.  When are confident that you can catch bugs and unmaintainable code with automated tests, you can rest easy because you know that any failures will most likely be small.


## Adding Process Is Not The Answer

While adding process might seem like a good idea in order to address code quality issues, it comes with a lot of overhead, so be wary.  Keep in mind that there are probably more effective ways to improve code quality than by adding process.
