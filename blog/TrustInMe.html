Trust in Me
#### MUST... NOT... TRUST... bleaehfeafehgarg!

In software development, as in life, trust is not only a necessity but also beneficial.  Trust is an important part of any relationship, personal or professional.  If you can't trust someone, then you need to take a hard look at your relationship and really ask yourself why he or she can't be trusted.  As our trust is broken, we become skeptical and guarded and stop trusting.  And without trust, things fall apart and life become unbearable.

## When we stop trusting... (getting burned)
There are many articles out there debating whether we are fully trusting when we are born.  I side with those who believe that our trust muscles fully developed and that it isn't until we experience our first broken promise that we stop trusting.

Perhaps as a child, you were promised a ninja turtle action figure if you cleaned your room.  So you immediately clean your room until it is spotless, dreaming of that beautiful, talking Michelangelo with *Kung-Fu action* the whole time.  But once your room is clean, your parents now require that you write all of your thank you notes from you plethora of birthday presents you received months before.  Upon looking back years later, you feel good about writing those thank-you's (because when else were you going to do them), but at the time you were furious because your parents had broken your trust and tricked you into doing more chores than they had originally promised.


The point is, As our trust is broken we become skeptical and guarded.


Should you stop trusting your parents because they tricked you into doing some extra chores that you should have done months ago?  I would say no.  Hopefully they are still providing you with food and shelter.  And ultimately looking back as an adult, you are probably glad that you didn't wait any longer to send out your thank-you's.

We have to keep in mind that trust is an important part of any relationship, personal or professional.  If you can't trust someone, then you need to take a hard look at your relationship and really ask yourself <em>why not</em>.

## The Trust Piggy Bank
A few years ago I participated in a team-building exercise, where I was first introduced to the concept of a <em>Trust Piggy Bank</em>.  Now this trust piggy bank is quite similar to a real bank, except instead of saving your money, it is filled up with trust.

Just like a real bank, you can make withdrawals and deposits, but it works slightly differently.  For example, when I do a favor for someone, or I do something that they think is good, I am making a deposit into their trust piggy bank.  Similarly, if I do something malicious or go behind someone's back to get my way, I am making a hefty withdrawal.

The tricky thing about a trust piggy bank is that you can only make deposits in max increments of 5 and withdrawals in minimum increments of 20.  The idea is that it takes longer to earn trust, than to burn through it.  It might take you 20 small good deeds (with a deposit amount of 1 each) in order to make up for one occurrence of going behind someone's back.

Also, keep in mind that you can easily go into trust debt and most people don't allow you to declare trust bankruptcy.  So make sure you are regularly balancing your trust checkbook!

## Trust empowers people
So, we've talked a little about why we stop trusting people, and we've talked about our <em>Trust Piggy Banks</em>, but we haven't talked about why trust is important.

One of the reasons that trust is so important is that it empowers people.  If you trust me with your life, unless I'm a horrible person, I'm not going to intentionally take advantage of that trust.  In fact, because I know how much you trust me, I am more likely to follow through on my commitments and work hard to make you happy with my decisions.

When you trust someone, you are giving them control of an aspect of your life.  It challenges that person to be the best version of him or herself.

So embrace trust and empower the people around you to be the best they can be.
