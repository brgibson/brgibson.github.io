#### MUST... NOT... TRUST... bleaehfeafehgarg!

In software development (and life!) trust is not only a necessity, but it can beneficial.  Trust is an important part of any relationship, personal or professional.  But as our trust is broken, we become skeptical, guarded, and we stop trusting.

## The Trust Piggy Bank
A few years ago I participated in a team-building exercise, where I was first introduced to the concept of a <em>Trust Piggy Bank</em>.  Now this trust piggy bank is quite similar to a real bank, except instead of saving your money, it is filled with trust.

Just like a real bank, you can make withdrawals and deposits, but it works slightly differently.  For example, when I do a favor for someone, or I do something that they appreciate, I am making a deposit into their trust piggy bank.  If I do something malicious or go behind someone's back to get my way, I am making a hefty withdrawal.

The tricky thing about a trust piggy bank is that you can only make deposits in max increments of 5 and withdrawals in minimum increments of 20.  The idea is that it takes longer to earn trust, than to burn through it.  It might take you 20 small good deeds (with a deposit amount of 1 each) in order to make up for one bad one.  Also, you can easily go into trust debt (and most people don't allow you to declare trust bankruptcy).  

So make sure you are regularly balancing your trust checkbook!

## Trust empowers people
Trust is important because it empowers people.  When you trust someone, you give them control of an aspect of your life.  It challenges that person to be the best version of him or herself, and they are more likely to do their best to make you happy with their decisions and follow through on commitments.

So embrace trust, and empower the people around you to be the best they can be.
