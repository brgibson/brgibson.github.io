h1. Javascript Notes

----

What is the correct spelling of Javascript (no caps, camel case)?

----

.firstChild 
- returns differently between browsers
- some return #text element if there is whitespace
- other's skip whitespace and return the first tag element 

Solution: 
	use .getElementsByTagName which recursively returns
	all the children of that node with the requested tag type
----

How do you remove Dom events? 
	(ie. after I click on a button, I want to stop the onClick 
	 event listener so that next time I click, it does nothing)
	 
- elemen.onclick = null
- the problem was the camel casing of onClick
	 
----

When using window.setTimeout, what is the cleanest way to stop an event?

- by using window.clearTimeout

var identifier = window.setTimeout(func, 1000);
window.clearTimeout(identifier);

----

When should you use the 'new' keyword?

?

----

How do I make a semantically logical grouping of buttons in html?

----

Closures: do private variables need to be inside of the closure?

----

Closures: can you create a closure with just a json oject to be returned?

----

How is it best to attach event listeners to dom elements?
(because you need to wait until the element has been created in the dom)

----

Closure confusion:


 	for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {

		 //this one always writes (element.length + 1)
 		 elements[i].onclick = function() { 
 					var test = function(index) {
 						document.write(index);
 					};
 					test(i); 
 			};

 			//this one write the expected value of i
 			elements[i].onclick = function(index) { 
 					return function() {
 						document.write(index);
 					};
 			}(i);
 	}
 	
 	*	The reason is because the bottom one executes the one argument
		method immediately, which saves the value of i in the function
		that is returned 
		
		In the top example, the function with an argument is not executed
		until the onclick event is fired, and by that time, i is 
		elements.length + 1 (because that is the value when the function
		that this code is written inside of exits) *
