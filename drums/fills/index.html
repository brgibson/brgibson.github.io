<ul>
    <li>#1 - Remember that playing nothing and crashing in a solid fill</li>
    <li>Try hitting both left and right cymbals on your crash of beat one</li>
    <li>Start your beat with closed hi-hat and left crash on beat one</li>
    <li>#4 - Bonham triplet (two bass-drums in a row to get beat one at the end)</li>
    <li>#5 - Half-bar fills can often be more effective. Only on beats 3/4, not an entire measure</li>
